Leysco Sales Transaction App
A mobile sales enablement application for field sales personnel, built with Flutter. The app allows users to create and manage sales orders, interact with customers, view product inventory in real-time, and receive notifications.

Responsible for fetching data from APIs or databases and providing it to the domain layer.

Handles repositories, data models, and database integration.

3. presentation

Manages screens, widgets, and state management.

Implements the business logic to communicate with the data layer to display necessary information.
